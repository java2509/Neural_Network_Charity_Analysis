#### Neural Network Charity Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: 

### Purpose:

Beks is going to use her knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to help Alphabet Soup predict whether the organizations that have received funding will be successful if funded.


### Results: 
 - Data Preprocessing:
 
1.) What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The target variable for this model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" COLUMN

2.) What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The features of the model are:

- APPLICATION_TYPE          
- AFFILIATION               
- CLASSIFICATION            
- USE_CASE                  
- ORGANIZATION              
- STATUS                    
- INCOME_AMOUNT                
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS    
- ASK_AMOUNT                   

3.) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

NAME and EIN were removed as it does not add to the accuracy to the model. 

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

1.) How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

2.) Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

3.) What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?




Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification 

problem, and explain your recommendation.
